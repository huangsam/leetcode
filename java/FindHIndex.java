     * cited at least h times.
     *
     * <p> The algorithm uses a frequency array to count papers with specific citation counts.
     * The array size is `citations.length + 1` to group citations exceeding the total
     * number of papers into the last bin.
     *
     * <p> After building the frequency array, the algorithm iterates from the highest
     * possible h-index down to 1. It keeps a running `sum` of papers with at least
     * the current index `i` citations. If `i` is less than or equal to `sum`, the
     * h-index is `i`. The first such `i` encountered is the maximum h-index.
     *
     * <p> If no valid `i` is found (e.g., no paper has at least 1 citation), the h-index is 0.
