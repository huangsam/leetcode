        We reverse a subset of the singly linked list from
        left <= right. Anything less than left and anything greater
        than right keeps the same ordering.

        The simplest way is to disconnect the left <= right subset
        from the linked list, reverse it and reconnect it back to
        the list afterward. Assuming that left > 1 or right still
        has at least one node afterward.

        Keep in mind that left can equal right. So in that case, nothing
        needs to be done as it were.
