class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 1:
            return 1

        # The solution is very similar to the bottoms-up DP approach
        # for fibonacci. To save on space, we use two variables
        # instead of a Python list
        f1, f2 = 1, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            current = f1 + f2
            f1 = f2
            f2 = current

        return f2
