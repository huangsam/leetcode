        You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single
        day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in
        the future to sell that stock.

        Return the maximum profit you can achieve from
        this transaction. If you cannot achieve any
        profit, return 0.

        prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
        output = 5

        Approach:
        - Look for smallest value for future days
        - If the current price is <= prev, update smallest
        - If the current price is > prev, calculate profit
        - Return the best positive profit you can find
