        When the symbol I is detected, followed by more Is, we are
        reaching a terminal endpoint.

        When any symbol is followed by a greater symbol, we subtract
        the value of the greater symbol by the smaller symbol.

        If a symbol is repeated, we multiply the frequency and then add
        it to the total.

        Otherwise, we continue to add the value of the current symbol
        to the total sum that we want.
