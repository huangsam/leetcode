        One possible approach is as follows:

        - Get length of list in one pass
        - Compute (k % length) and create a pointer at this distance
        - Set left node as head, set right node as head + distance
        - Iterate until next pointer of distance pointer is null (i.e. tail)
        - Unlink left.next from the target node
        - Link tail.next to the original head
        - Return the target node
