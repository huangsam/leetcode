        On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can
        only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you
        can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

        Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

        Approach:
        - Handle base cases of empty prices and one price
        - Calculate profit whenever stock drops
        - Calculate leftover profits at the very end
